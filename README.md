Haskell
=======

Meh, I wanna learn Haskell.  I'm pinning this repo and updating every day I work
on it to try and keep myself honest.

REPL
----

`ghci` is the repl

Set a "nicer" prompt with `:set prompt "> "`

`:l file` to load a file (no need for the `.hs` extension)

`:r` to reload it

`:let` to define a name

`:t` to see the type of something

### Feb 6, 2018
After re-watching a Chris Allan video I'd watched a couple of years ago and
reading some of his stuff, I found out that he doesn't recommend LYAH for
reasons that seem legit.  I started to read through the cis194 class.  I also
learned I shouldn't use haskell platform and instead use stack.  I think
homebrew just installs stack when you `brew install haskell-platform` anyway...
I'll have to check on that.

Started pretty late and made it mostly through list comprehensions in the
Starting Out chapter of LYAH.
