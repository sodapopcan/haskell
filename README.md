Haskell
=======

There are my scatter brain notes while I teach myself Haskell.  I'm pinning this
repo and updating every day I work on it to try and keep myself honest.

REPL
----

`ghci` is the repl

Set a "nicer" prompt with `:set prompt "> "`

`:l file` to load a file (no need for the `.hs` extension)

`:r` to reload any files loaded with `:l`

`:let` to define a name

`:t` to see the type of something

Watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DebDaiYev2M) video.  Started on
the types chapter, otherwise, just played around with list comprehensions on the
repl.  Not a super productive session as I didn't have a lot of time.

### Feb 8, 2018
Decided to keep going through LAYH good anyway, but going to be aware of the the
points pointed out int
[this](http://bitemyapp.com/posts/2014-12-31-functional-education.html) blog post.  I would like to at least finish the second chapter on types and maybe go on to the next chapter on functions.  Basically I might want to stop when it starts talking about foreign concepts?  Currying is not a foreign concept but mondois and monads are.  All I know is that they are a way of dealing with state

After re-watching a Chris Allan video I'd watched a couple of years ago and
reading some of his stuff, I found out that he doesn't recommend LYAH for
reasons that seem legit.  I started to read through the cis194 class.  I also
learned I shouldn't use haskell platform and instead use stack.  I think
homebrew just installs stack when you `brew install haskell-platform` anyway...
I'll have to check on that.

### Feb 5, 2018
Started pretty late and made it mostly through list comprehensions in the
Starting Out chapter of LYAH.
